2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## About the Stack

The application is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a Flask and SQLAlchemy server. app.py defines the endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
